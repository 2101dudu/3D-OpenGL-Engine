Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is often called Earth's "twin" or "sister" planet, having the closest orbit and the most similar mass and size to Earth among the planets of the Solar System. While both are rocky planets, Venus has a significantly thicker and denser atmosphere than Earth and any other rocky planet in the Solar System. It is composed of mostly carbon dioxide (CO2), with a global sulfuric acid cloud cover and no liquid water. At the average surface level the atmosphere reaches a temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level, turning the lowest layer of the carbon dioxide atmosphere into a supercritical fluid. Venus is the third brightest object in Earth's sky, after the Moon and the Sun, and, like Mercury, always appears relatively close to the Sun, either as a "morning star" or an "evening star", resulting from orbiting closer (inferior) to the Sun than Earth.

While the orbit of Venus is the closest to Earth's, the most inferior orbiting Mercury stays for a longer time closer to all the superior orbiting planets, Venus and Earth approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. Venus though is the planet with the lowest delta-v needed to travel to from Earth, and is therefore often used for gravity assists and as a common waypoint for interplanetary flights from Earth. A Venusian day is 116.75 Earth days long, about half a Venusian solar year, which is 224.7 Earth days long. The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the currents and drag of its atmosphere.
